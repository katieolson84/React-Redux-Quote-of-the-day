> This app generates a random Ron Swanson quote from Parks and Rec. I used the following:

<p>React.js: structured code that is easy to understand and scalable</p>
<p>Redux.js: Used to manage state
<p>Styled Components: all styled are on the seperate components aside from global styles which are applied in the App</p>

## Install

```sh
npm start
```
